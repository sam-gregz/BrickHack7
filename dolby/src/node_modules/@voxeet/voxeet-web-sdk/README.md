Voxeet Javascript SDK

The Voxeet SDK is an UMD Module that can be imported directly in the browser or via a npm package.

The SDK is asynchronous and uses promise at his core. Voxeet is natively running on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge.

## Changelog

### 3.0.3

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a camera issue that occurred when participants joined conferences using Apple MacBook Pro 16’’ and the Safari browser.
- Removed the deprecated dependencies to disable the unnecessary media engine warning, which occurred during the SDK installation.

### 3.0.2

#### Bug Fixes

- Introduced minor bug fixes and performance improvements.

### 3.0.1

#### Bug Fixes

- Disabled the ability to open new WebSockets by calling the session.open() method when an open WebSocket already exists.

### 3.0.0

#### Features

- Introduced Dolby Voice support to improve voice quality and make virtual meetings more natural and productive. The Dolby Voice article describes in detail the significant changes to Interactivity APIs.
- Introduced improved video resolution scaling in non-simulcast transmissions. The resolution is based on the available bitrate and the number of conference participants.

#### Changes

- Deprecated the 3D immersive calls functionality. The SDK 3.0 introduces Dolby Voice, which offers a spatial audio experience.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with the Safari browser not playing any audio during conferences. The issue is caused by the Safari auto-play policy, which does not play audio unless Safari has permission to access a participant's camera. To resolve this issue, the Web SDK 3.0 generates a new autoplayBlocked event when Safari rejects the play() element. This requires creating an additional interaction event that requests camera access. If a participant grants access, a new playBlockedAudio method enables audio.
- Fixed an issue where a refresh of a conference participant resulted in not playing this participant audio to a participant who joined a conference using Safari. The fix is available only for Dolby Voice conferences.

### 2.4.4

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with retrieving a file presentation preview for application users who are not present at a conference. The updated image and thumbnail methods introduce a new fieldId parameter that specifies the file ID. If a value of the parameter is not provided, the SDK uses the current presentation.

### 2.4.3

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with an error occurring during screen-share.

### 2.4.2

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where a new remote participant's audio canno't be heared while beeing on another tab.
- Fixed an issue with the WebSocket throwing an exception while normally closing the session.
- Fixed an issue with the management of the onbeforeunload event throwing an exception when not in a conference.

- Fixed an issue with receiving a new remote participant's audio when the application browser tab is not in focus.
- Fixed an issue with the [ConferenceUninitializedError](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/model/conferenceerror) occurring during the application refresh.
- Fixed an issue with the [WebSocketError](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/model/websocketerror) occurring when the application leaves a conference.

### 2.4.1

#### Bug Fixes

- Temporarily disabled the auto camera resolution network adaptation behavior.

### 2.4

#### Features

- Introduced camera resolution auto adaption based on the server-specified available transmission bandwidth. The feature is available only on Chrome and Safari for non-simulcast clients and does not apply to screen-share functionality.
- Introduced the `average` and `max` value of the [rtcpMode](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/model/conferenceparameters#rtcpmode), deprecated the `best` value.
- Introduced a mechanism to report client-side exceptions to the service for centralized diagnostics.
- Added a feature to report a reason for the client leaving a conference.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with a promise that could not be rejected or resolved while calling the [startVideo](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/conferenceservice#startvideo) method with no camera access.
- Fixed an issue with media transmission quality indicator not working on Safari and Firefox.
- Fixed an issue with emitting the [CreateAnswerError](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/model/peererror) exception after joining a conference.
- Fixed an issue where the SDK has returned `0` after calling the [audioLevel](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/conferenceservice#audiolevel) method on Safari.
- Reduced the chance of frozen video at the far end when the user closes the browser tab to leave a conference.

### 2.3.1

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with emitting `ended`.

### 2.3.0

#### Features

- The following new reference models provide additional information about errors: [BrowserError](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/model/browsererror), [ConferenceError](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/model/conferenceerror), [MediaStreamError](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/model/mediastreamerror), [PeerError](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/model/peererror), [ServerError](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/model/servererror).

- The new [qualityIndicators](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/conferenceservice#qualityindicators) event and the new [QualityIndicator](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/model/qualityindicator) model provide information about the Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) for audio and video.

- The new [switched](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/conferenceservice#switched) event informs that a connected participant joins a conference using another device and the same `ExternalId`. This enables transferring the call to the newly connected device.

- Fixed an issue with emitting the [ended](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/reference-javascript/conferenceservice#ended) event at the end of conferences.
